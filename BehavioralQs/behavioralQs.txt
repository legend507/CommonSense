1. Tell me about two suggestions you have made to your supervisor in the past year. How did you come up with the ideas? What happened? How do you feel about the way things went?
    - Techinial advises. To train SELinux policy maker inside of the compony. 
    - To do communication pannel presentation. Different people assigned to different projects, working separately. To encourage people to talk and exchange informations. 1 hour/week, to have a team member present something (either technical or customer-related info). And put more pictures, less text.

2. In the past, how have you obtained and incorporated customer feedback into your organization's planning and service standards? Give specific examples.
    - Reflect customer feedback to company's planning, YES. Vehicle OEMs are my customers. My work in panasonic was to firstly present Panasonic's automotive IoT roadmap to OEM, get their feedback, build prototype based on the road map, presesnt and get their feedback.
        The project I was working on was a cloud-based vehicle monitoring system. One feedback I got from them is that there maybe delay between the cloud and a vehicle. 
        Meaning there vehicle sends log to cloud, cloud detect some anomaly and command vehicle to stop. The time may be too long for this process. 
        One solution I came up with was to put a simple signiture-based detecting system inside of vehicle. So if that system detects something strange, it can cut the fuse or something, stop hacker's next attack.

3. Describe a situation where you were responsible for getting others to make a change. What role did you play and what actions did you take? What was the outcome? If you had to do it again, would you do anything differently?
    - The way of storing documents. Old way was to create a folder, puting the documents in, and with each update, manually copy the old document and rename it with a bigger version number.
        The method I proposed was to use git (make a local gitlab server), or SVN to manager the document, just like the source codes.
        I built the gitlab using team's server. And put all the document I make inside. Also, I sent emails to all my colleagues in the team, with instructions on how to do that.
        The outcome was NOT good. Maybe because of old inertia. Now only me and another younger member of the team is using the gitlab, while other senior team members doing things the old way.
        The change I may do is not use gitlab, instead use some easier storage like Google Drive (NoSQL?).

4. How does the work you are currently doing affect your organization's ability to meet its mission and goals? Do you think your work is important? If yes, why? If no, why not?
    - My work is Automotive IoT Cybersecurity.
