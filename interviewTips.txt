Q: Your Weaknesses?
A: Sometimes, I don’t have a very good attention to detail. While that’s good because it lets me execute quickly, it also means that I sometimes make careless mistakes. Because of that, I make sure to always have someone else double check my work.”
MyA: Compared to my Japanese colleagues, I think my lack of attention to details is my greatest weakness. I execute quickly, a work that my Japanese colleagues need 2 days, I can do it in 2 hours. And I sometimes make careless mistakes.
