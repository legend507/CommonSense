# Example of XML (.xml) file and its schema (.xsd) files.
Backgroud: XML schema is used to "validate" a xml file.

In this folder, 3 methods to write a .xsd is demostrated.
1st method is the simplest one. Do NOT use in real projects.
2nd method is a better one.
3rd method is also a better one.

The best method is to combinet 2nd and 3rd, i.e. to define all base attributes, elements, types first. And then define the framework based on those.

FYI, JSON also has its schema (2018.08, on draft-07), but it is much less widely used.
